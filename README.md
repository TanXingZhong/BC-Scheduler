## Overview

This Scheduler Web Application helps users organize and manage their schedules, events, and tasks by providing a convenient platform for adding, editing, and viewing schedules. The app is built with:

- **Frontend**: The user interface, developed using React, where users can interact with the application.
- **Backend**: A Node.js-based server that handles business logic, data storage, and communication with the frontend.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the application locally, ensure that the following tools are installed:

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime required to run both the frontend and backend. Download and install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en).
- **Git**: A version control system to clone the repository. Download and install it from [here](https://git-scm.com).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

### Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local device:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL of your Git repository.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the frontend project**:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Start the frontend development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run
   ```

Your frontend should now be running. The application will usually be accessible at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) by default.

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the backend directory**:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install the required backend dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the backend project**:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Start the backend server**:

   ```bash
   npm run
   ```

The backend server should now be running, typically accessible at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) (depending on your configuration).

## Development Workflow

Once both frontend and backend servers are running, you can interact with the Scheduler Web Application via your browser.

- **Frontend URL**: Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to access the user interface.
- **Backend URL**: The backend will be running on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) (or the port you configured).

You can now begin working on the application, adding features, fixing bugs, or adjusting the user interface.

## Usage

After setting up both frontend and backend, here are some of the features you can access:

- **View and manage schedules**: Add, edit, or delete schedules for specific tasks or events.
- **User Authentication**: Log in to personalize your scheduling experience.
- **Calendar Integration**: Synchronize your schedules with a calendar.
