Usage
This Scheduler Web Application helps users organize and manage their schedules, events, and tasks by providing a convenient platform for adding, editing, and viewing schedules. The app is built with a React-based frontend and a Node.js backend.

Frontend: The user interface where users can interact with the application.
Backend: Handles business logic, data storage, and communication with the frontend.
Prerequisites
Before setting up the application locally, ensure that the following tools are installed:

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime required to run both the frontend and backend.
Download and install it from here.
Git: Version control system to clone the repository.
Download and install it from here.
Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the repository to your local device:

git clone <repository-url>
Replace <repository-url> with the URL of your Git repository.

Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory:
cd <path-to-repository>/frontend
Install the required dependencies:
npm install
Build the frontend project:
npm run build
Start the frontend development server:
npm run
Your frontend should now be running. The application will usually be accessible at http://localhost:5173 by default.

Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory:
Install the required backend dependencies:
npm install
Build the backend project:
npm run build
Start the backend server:
npm run
The backend server should now be running, typically accessible at http://localhost:8080 (depending on your configuration).

Development Workflow
Once both frontend and backend servers are running, you can interact with the Scheduler Web Application via your browser.

Frontend URL: Open http://localhost:5173 to access the user interface.
Backend URL: The backend will be running on http://localhost:8080 (or the port you configured).
You can now begin working on the application, adding features, fixing bugs, or adjusting the user interface.

Usage
After setting up both frontend and backend, here are some of the features you can access:

View and manage schedules: Add, edit, or delete schedules for specific tasks or events.
User Authentication: Login to personalize your scheduling experience.
Calendar Integration: Synchronize your schedules with a calendar.
